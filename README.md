# PortMaster Bind Directories
## Bind Mount Fix for exFAT FS (Knulli, Batocera)

In order to support the exFAT file system on [Knulli](https://knulli.org/) and [Batocera](https://batocera.org/), a new core function was added to PortMaster (`bind_directories`) to replace the previous method of using symbolic links. This resulted in many ports getting updated which now need to be tested. For status and progress, check our [**Discord Testing Thread**](https://discord.com/channels/1122861252088172575/1315085237788868608)

### Installation Instructions:

The instructions will apply to **all** of the ports tested in this post:
1. If you have the port already, uninstall it through PortMaster GUI: Manage Games > Game Info > Uninstall. 
2. Copy the `.zip` file to the `autoinstall` directory within the [PortMaster directory for your device](https://portmaster.games/installation.html#via-zip).
  * Option 1: Use SMB, SSH, or any other method provided by your CFW
  * Option 2: If your device supports it, remove micro-sd from device and copy files with computer
4. Start PortMaster and allow the auto-installation to continue.
5. Quit PortMaster and restart EmulationStation or your device.
6. Launch the port from the Ports section of ES.

#### Important

You must enable alpha builds in PortMaster to accurately test this functionality. See the Discord for more details.

### Testing

The port must be tested on the following fimwares to be considered as a passed test:
- Knulli
- Any other PM-supported CFW (ArkOS, ROCKNIX, AnberELEC, etc.)

In order consider the test passed for your device / CFW combo the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. The port loads without issue, even after rebooting the device.
2. The saves/settings persist, even after rebooting the device.
3. If port was installed previously, the existing saves/settings were preserved when testing the new version.
